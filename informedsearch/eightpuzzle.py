'''
This block of code implements a GPS to find a route between 2 cities by using Greedy Best First algorithm,
which uses the least estimated distance to destination to choose the next node to be analysed.
At Search 4, there is a example where this algorithm fails to find a solution, as closer city to destination
has no route to there.
This problem is solved by using BestFirst.
